This project is a web-based rewrite of Egonet, which can be found on [SourceForge](http://egonet.sf.net). These two projects will soon be merged.

Differences from the desktop version on SourceForge
---------------------------------------------------

* Different file format for study and respondent data - necessary to support new features.
* Study authors can decide how respondents will be identified.
* More sophisticated skip-logic and alter linking based on named, boolean expressions.
* Number of alters can be configured as a range (optionally with no upper limit) rather than a fixed number.
* Alter and alter pair questions can be asked separately for each alter, or asked once with a list of alters.
* Responses to category questions can be reordered.
* New category question preset: kin.
* Category questions can allow multiple selections.
* Data is saved continuously to a database, rather than only saving when a study or interview is closed, so accidental data loss is less likely.

Additional features planned for this version
--------------------------------------------

* While creating a question, preview what it will look like while interviewing.
* Navigable list of questions in the sidebar during an interview.
* "Refuse" and "don't know" options added to each question.
* Can attach an introduction screen to any question.
* Optional limit to range of numeric questions.
* Interactive settings for visualizing social networks.
* Support for web surveys.
